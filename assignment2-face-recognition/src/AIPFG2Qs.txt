A) TheFaceRecognizer::predict method returns a label indicating a match
 has been found. Is it possible to obtain a measure of the systemâ€™s confi
dence in that match?

Answer: Yes, this method can give a confidence score. A lower score means a better match.

B) Does the program compensate if you are far from the camera? Might a
 cascading classifier help? 

Answer: No, the program does not adjust if you are too far away from the camera. A cascading classifier could help. It could help by detecting the faces at different sizes.
